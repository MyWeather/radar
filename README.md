# MyWeather Radar
Our site uses a similar radar implementation, you can feel free to make a pull request for future changes if you want!

## Requirements
In order to use MyWeather Radar you must do the following:
- Have a Google Maps API Key
- Mention somewhere on your site that you are using MyWeather Radar and link back to this repo

## Usage
By default, radar already uses all of following on the main radar page:
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- jQuery
- radar.js
- radar.css

## More Info
Eventually the readme will have implementation techniques and other stuff. Also, eventually Radar will include lazy load so the page can load before the radar does, like other weather sites!
