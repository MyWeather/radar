# MyWeather Radar
Our site uses a similar radar implementation, you can feel free to make a pull request for future changes if you want! Using this repository does not entitle you to copy our content from our website(s), instead, you may only use what is here. More features *could* be implemented in the future upon pull request or issue.

## Requirements
In order to use MyWeather Radar you must do the following:
- Mention somewhere on your site that you are using MyWeather.Today's Radar and link back to this repository.

## Usage
By default, radar already uses all of following on the main radar page:
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- jQuery
- radar.js
- radar.css

This app is basically *plug and play*, download the files, extract them in a folderm and open `index.html` and your show will be on the road.

## More Info
Eventually the README will have implementation techniques and other stuff. Also, eventually Radar will include lazy load so the page can load before the radar does, like other weather sites!
